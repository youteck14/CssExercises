Welcome to the 30 exercises in CSS course.

The goal is to practice CSS, challenge yourself and improve your research.
We will also focus on testing and self-correction skills.

You can see that I prepared two folders for you :

- The "1.Starter Files" is the folder in which you will solve all the exercises,
it contains the 30 exercises with their respective resources.

Once you have tried to solve an exercise, you can watch the correction video.
To properly watch a correction video, you can comment out what you have produced and then follow the correction by coding with me.
(shortcut to comment out in a file other than .txt: [ctrl + :])

- The "2. Completed Exercises" is the folder which contains the final source code of all the exercises.
It can be useful to correct yourself.
It can be useful if you need the exact code for a project on your own.
It can also be useful if you followed a video and your code does not work, before sending me a message, check with the final source code and try to find your mistake, it is very educational.


Good code, good learning and see you soon,
Enzo.
